This bot was created to farm Time Cubes in TimeClickers http://www.timegamers.com/TimeClickers/ and I have publised an older version of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjaJT_s9LPE

This repo is made available for people to build upon or learn from. The bot itself it outdated as I stopped playing the game shortly after making the video. Some features of it is now possible redundant.

The structure is fairly simple, you have a main script file that loads a file in libs, and that's about it.
Outside of playing the game it can/could create logs, take screenshots and export your save to file.

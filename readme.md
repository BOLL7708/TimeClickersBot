This bot was created to farm Time Cubes in the TimeClickers game: http://www.timegamers.com/TimeClickers/ 
I have publised a video if it running here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjaJT_s9LPE
This runs in AutoIt which you can find here: https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/

This repo is made available for people to build upon or learn from. The bot itself it outdated as I stopped playing the game shortly after making the video. Some features of it is now possibly redundant.

The structure is fairly simple, you have a main script file that loads a library, the only thing you need to edit is the script file if you want to make functional changes. Outside of that there are extra settings in the settings file which can be updated live by the bot if you do live adjustments.

There are key commands listed at the bottom of the main script file, it uses the function keys.

Outside of playing the game it can/could create logs, take screenshots and export your save to file.
